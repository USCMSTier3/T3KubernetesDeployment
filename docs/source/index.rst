Introduction
============
The following documentation describes the steps followed in order to deploy a USCMS Tier-3 on top of Kubernetes, via SLATE.

`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_ is an industrial open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

The `SLATE project <https://slateci.io/>`_ enables a federated "NoOPs" operations model that gives cyberinfrastructure developers the flexibility to innovate at scale, expanding the reach of domain specific science gateways and multi-site research platforms. It supports several T3-related components in its `app list <https://portal.slateci.io/applications>`_, like Hosted CEs, HTCondor, OSG Frontier SQUID, etc.
